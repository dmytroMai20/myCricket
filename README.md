## Backend: 
 - Weather handling (weather api, weather class, weather condition)
 - Map handling (google api) - now openlayers since google api is paid.
 - Match and location and match handler - done.
## Frontend:
 - homescreen/watchscreen containing all the matches
 - display data by creating new match and then accessing weatherconditions
 - favorites screen containing favorite locations
 - display all the data about locations
 - Pages for adding matches/locations. Leave a blank WebView in javafx to 
   allow for an openlayers map and search bar to be added. Matches need an 
   input to enter time, locations just need the webview box.
